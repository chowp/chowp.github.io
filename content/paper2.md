#questions:

I only read the author's presentation ppt, I abandon reading the paper. I have the following question which may be solved in the pdf version.

1. What 's the different of mac loss rate between AP and client?
2. How to adjuct channnel use only airtime utilization information? 

Summary, simple examples, controlled experiment, which is not very convincing for me.

- **channel selection**
- **central traffic control**
- **active configuraton** : This is based on the pattern prediction on strong correlated time-series.

# what can I learn from this paper?
Controlled experiment is accepted by INFOCOM, aha...
